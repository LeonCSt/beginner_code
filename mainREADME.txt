Welcome to my repo.                     [250915]

My current pursuit: C++ programming stand alone GUI client desktop
    applications. In the process of learning how to take the reigns
    of X11 and Wayland (at a core level if possible), I am in the
    habit of creating a progressive set of simple beginner code
    examples. This is for my own benefit, and because they represent
    a lot of hard work and learning, I would like to publish them
    for the benefit of other beginners in a similar path.

In my opinion there are very few recent code examples online. Of the
    few that you do find - they are often in C  - not C++ .

Disclaimer: My coding may be novice, but they work as intended in
    their simplicity.

Credit to the manuals, wiki, header and xml files on these subjects
    and all the forum contributers that have helped me.
